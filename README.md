# Mondrian Chord-Visualizer
This experiment visualizes microtonal chords using a Piet Mondrian-style generated image.
On the left is a resizable image (click the black bars!).
As the image proportions change, the notes in the chord change to reflect the new area of each sub-rectangle.
On the right, we notate the actual chord being played using [vexflow](https://www.vexflow.com/).

`npx vite` FTW.
